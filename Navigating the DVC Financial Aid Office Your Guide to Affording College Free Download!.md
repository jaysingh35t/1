## Understanding the Basics: What is Financial Aid?

Financial aid encompasses a variety of funding sources designed to help students pay for college. These sources typically include:

*   **Grants:** Gift aid that doesn't need to be repaid, often based on financial need. Common examples include the Pell Grant and the California College Promise Grant (formerly the Board of Governors Fee Waiver).
*   **Loans:** Borrowed money that must be repaid with interest. Federal student loans are generally preferable to private loans due to their lower interest rates and flexible repayment options.

*   **Scholarships:** Gift aid, often based on academic merit, talent, or specific criteria, that doesn't need to be repaid. Scholarships can come from various sources, including colleges, universities, foundations, and private organizations.
