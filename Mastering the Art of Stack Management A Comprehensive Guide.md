## What is a Stack?

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle. Imagine a stack of plates â€“ you can only add a new plate to the top, and you can only remove the topmost plate. This LIFO nature is what defines the stack's behavior and makes it suitable for specific tasks.

Think of a stack as a container where the last item you put in is the first item you take out. This characteristic makes it perfect for scenarios where you need to keep track of the order in which items were added and need to retrieve them in reverse order.

## Basic Stack Operations

Stacks typically support the following fundamental operations:

*   **Push:** Adds an element to the top of the stack. This operation increases the stack's size by one.
*   **Pop:** Removes the element at the top of the stack. This operation decreases the stack's size by one.
*   **Peek (or Top):** Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it. This allows you to inspect the topmost element without modifying the stack.
*   **IsEmpty:** Checks if the stack is empty. Returns `true` if the stack contains no elements, and `false` otherwise.
*   **Size:** Returns the number of elements currently in the stack.

These operations allow you to effectively manage the data stored within the stack, adding elements, retrieving them, and checking the stack's status.

## Implementing Stacks

Stacks can be implemented using various underlying data structures, primarily arrays and linked lists. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages:

*   **Array-Based Implementation:** Uses a contiguous block of memory to store the stack elements. This is generally more efficient in terms of memory access due to spatial locality. However, the stack's size must be predetermined at the time of creation, which can lead to wasted space if the stack doesn't grow to its maximum capacity, or overflow if it exceeds its capacity.

    ```python
    class Stack:
        def __init__(self, capacity):
            self.capacity = capacity
            self.stack = [None] * capacity
            self.top = -1

        def is_empty(self):
            return self.top == -1

        def is_full(self):
            return self.top == self.capacity - 1

        def push(self, item):
            if self.is_full():
                print("Stack Overflow!")
                return
            self.top += 1
            self.stack[self.top] = item

        def pop(self):
            if self.is_empty():
                print("Stack Underflow!")
                return None
            item = self.stack[self.top]
            self.stack[self.top] = None  # Optional: Clear the slot
            self.top -= 1
            return item

        def peek(self):
            if self.is_empty():
                return None
            return self.stack[self.top]

        def size(self):
            return self.top + 1
    ```

*   **Linked List-Based Implementation:** Uses nodes connected through pointers to store the stack elements. This approach is more flexible in terms of size, as the stack can grow or shrink dynamically as needed. However, it requires additional memory for storing the pointers and can be slightly slower due to the need to traverse the linked list.

    ```python
    class Node:
        def __init__(self, data):
            self.data = data
            self.next = None

    class Stack:
        def __init__(self):
            self.top = None
            self.size = 0

        def is_empty(self):
            return self.top is None

        def push(self, item):
            new_node = Node(item)
            new_node.next = self.top
            self.top = new_node
            self.size += 1

        def pop(self):
            if self.is_empty():
                print("Stack Underflow!")
                return None
            item = self.top.data
            self.top = self.top.next
            self.size -= 1
            return item

        def peek(self):
            if self.is_empty():
                return None
            return self.top.data

        def size(self):
            return self.size
    ```

Choosing the right implementation depends on the specific requirements of your application. If you know the maximum size of the stack beforehand and memory efficiency is crucial, an array-based implementation might be a good choice. If you need a dynamic stack that can grow or shrink as needed, a linked list-based implementation would be more suitable.

## Applications of Stacks

Stacks have a wide range of applications in computer science, including:

*   **Function Call Management:** When a function is called, its information (local variables, return address) is pushed onto the call stack. When the function returns, this information is popped off the stack, allowing the program to resume execution at the correct location.
*   **Expression Evaluation:** Stacks are used to evaluate arithmetic expressions, particularly those involving parentheses and operator precedence. The stack stores operators and operands, allowing the program to correctly apply the operators in the right order.  Consider evaluating "2 + 3 * 4".  A stack can be used to push 2, then push 3, then push 4. When the '*' operator is encountered, it pops 3 and 4, multiplies them, and pushes the result (12) back onto the stack.  Then, when the '+' operator is encountered, it pops 2 and 12, adds them, and pushes the result (14) back onto the stack. The final result is then popped from the stack.
*   **Backtracking Algorithms:** In algorithms that explore multiple possibilities, such as solving mazes or playing games, stacks can be used to keep track of the path taken. If a dead end is reached, the algorithm can backtrack by popping elements off the stack until it finds a viable path.
*   **Undo/Redo Functionality:** Many applications provide undo/redo functionality. Stacks can be used to store the history of actions performed by the user. The "undo" operation pops the last action from the stack and reverts the application to its previous state. The "redo" operation pushes the undone action back onto the stack.
*   **Depth-First Search (DFS):** In graph traversal, DFS uses a stack to keep track of the nodes to visit. It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
*   **Reversing a String:**  A string can be reversed by pushing each character onto a stack and then popping them off in reverse order to form the reversed string.

These examples demonstrate the versatility of stacks and their importance in solving various computational problems.
