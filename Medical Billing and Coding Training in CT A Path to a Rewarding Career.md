Medical billing and coding are essential components of the healthcare revenue cycle. Medical coders translate diagnoses, procedures, and services into standardized alphanumeric codes using systems like ICD-10-CM, CPT, and HCPCS Level II. Medical billers then use these codes to create and submit claims to insurance companies for reimbursement. Accuracy and efficiency in both processes are crucial for healthcare providers to receive timely and accurate payments.
