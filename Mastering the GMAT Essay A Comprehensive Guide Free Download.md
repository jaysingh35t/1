## Understanding the GMAT AWA

The GMAT AWA section requires you to analyze a given argument and critique its reasoning. You will have 30 minutes to read the argument, plan your essay, and write your response. The argument will typically be a short paragraph making a claim and providing supporting evidence. Your task is not to agree or disagree with the argument but to evaluate its logical soundness.

**Key Objectives:**

*   **Critical Thinking:** Identify flaws in the argument's logic and reasoning.
*   **Analytical Skills:** Deconstruct the argument into its constituent parts and analyze the relationship between them.
*   **Communication Skills:** Express your analysis clearly, concisely, and persuasively.

**Scoring:**

The AWA is scored on a scale of 0 to 6, with 0 being the lowest and 6 being the highest. Your essay is graded by both a computer algorithm and a human reader. The final score is a combination of these two evaluations. While the AWA score has a relatively small weight compared to the quant and verbal scores, it is still an important factor in the overall admission process, demonstrating your analytical and communication prowess. Business schools use the AWA to assess your ability to think critically and articulate your thoughts effectively.

## Analyzing the Argument

The first and most crucial step is to thoroughly analyze the argument presented to you. Don't rush into writing; spend a significant portion of your time dissecting the argument and identifying its flaws.

**Common Logical Fallacies:**

*   **Hasty Generalization:** Drawing a conclusion based on insufficient evidence.
*   **Correlation vs. Causation:** Assuming that because two things are correlated, one causes the other.
*   **Ad Hominem:** Attacking the person making the argument rather than the argument itself.
*   **Appeal to Authority:** Relying on the opinion of an unqualified authority figure.
*   **False Dichotomy:** Presenting only two options when more exist.
*   **Straw Man:** Misrepresenting an opponent's argument to make it easier to attack.
*   **Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc:** Assuming that because one event followed another, the first event caused the second.
*   **Circular Reasoning:** Using the conclusion as evidence to support the conclusion.
*   **Appeal to Emotion:** Manipulating the audience's emotions rather than using logic.
*   **Composition/Division:** Assuming that what is true of the parts must also be true of the whole (or vice versa).

**Steps for Analyzing the Argument:**

1.  **Identify the Conclusion:** What is the main point the author is trying to make?
2.  **Identify the Evidence:** What reasons or data does the author provide to support the conclusion?
3.  **Identify the Assumptions:** What unstated beliefs or premises underlie the argument?
4.  **Identify the Flaws:** Where does the argument fall apart? Are there any logical fallacies? Are there alternative explanations? Are there missing pieces of information?
5.  **Consider Alternative Explanations:** Could there be other reasons for the presented information?
6.  **Evaluate the Impact of Missing Information:** What information, if known, would significantly strengthen or weaken the argument?

**Example:**

*Argument:*

"A recent study found that students who attend tutoring sessions score higher on standardized tests. Therefore, all students should be required to attend tutoring sessions to improve their test scores."

*Analysis:*

*   **Conclusion:** All students should be required to attend tutoring sessions to improve their test scores.
*   **Evidence:** A recent study found that students who attend tutoring sessions score higher on standardized tests.
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Tutoring is the *cause* of the higher test scores.
    *   The study is representative of all students.
    *   All students would benefit from tutoring.
*   **Flaws:**
    *   Correlation vs. Causation: Students who attend tutoring may be more motivated or have a stronger academic background, which could explain the higher scores.
    *   Hasty Generalization: The study may not be representative of all students.
    *   Ignores other factors that contribute to higher test scores, such as study habits, classroom instruction, and innate abilities.

## Structuring Your Essay

A well-structured essay is crucial for presenting your analysis clearly and persuasively. A typical GMAT essay structure consists of five paragraphs:

1.  **Introduction:** Briefly introduce the topic and state your overall assessment of the argument.
2.  **Body Paragraph 1:** Identify and analyze the first flaw in the argument.
3.  **Body Paragraph 2:** Identify and analyze the second flaw in the argument.
4.  **Body Paragraph 3:** Identify and analyze the third flaw in the argument (or discuss the need for additional evidence).
5.  **Conclusion:** Summarize your analysis and restate your overall assessment of the argument.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

*   **Introduction:**
    *   Start with a broad statement about the argument's topic.
    *   Briefly describe the argument's conclusion and supporting evidence.
    *   State your thesis: The argument is flawed because it relies on several unproven assumptions and unsupported claims.
*   **Body Paragraphs:**
    *   Begin each paragraph with a topic sentence that clearly identifies the flaw you will be discussing.
    *   Explain why the flaw is a weakness in the argument.
    *   Provide specific examples to illustrate your point.
    *   Suggest how the argument could be strengthened by addressing the flaw.
*   **Conclusion:**
    *   Summarize the flaws you have identified.
    *   Reiterate your overall assessment of the argument.
    *   Avoid introducing new arguments or evidence in the conclusion.
    *   End with a concluding statement that emphasizes the argument's weakness.

## Crafting Effective Arguments

The key to a high-scoring GMAT essay is to develop compelling and well-supported arguments that demonstrate your critical thinking abilities.

**Elements of a Strong Argument:**

*   **Clarity:** Make sure your arguments are clear and easy to understand.
*   **Specificity:** Provide specific examples to support your claims.
*   **Logic:** Ensure that your arguments are logically sound and free of fallacies.
*   **Relevance:** Focus on the most important flaws in the argument and avoid getting sidetracked by minor details.
*   **Persuasion:** Write persuasively to convince the reader that your analysis is correct.

**Techniques for Developing Strong Arguments:**

*   **Identify Underlying Assumptions:** Expose the unstated assumptions upon which the argument relies and demonstrate why those assumptions are questionable.
*   **Present Alternative Explanations:** Offer alternative explanations for the evidence presented in the argument.
*   **Highlight Missing Information:** Explain what information is needed to evaluate the argument properly and how that information would affect the conclusion.
*   **Consider Potential Consequences:** Discuss the potential negative consequences of accepting the argument's conclusion.

## Improving Your Writing Style

While content is paramount, a clear and concise writing style enhances the impact of your analysis.

**Key Writing Principles:**
