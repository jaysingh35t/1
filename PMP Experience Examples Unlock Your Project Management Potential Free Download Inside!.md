## Understanding the PMP Experience Requirements

Before diving into examples, let's solidify the foundational understanding of the PMP experience prerequisites. PMI requires candidates to demonstrate a certain amount of project management experience, which varies based on your education level:

*   **With a four-year degree:** At least 36 months leading projects and 35 hours of project management education/training or CAPM® Certification.
*   **With a secondary degree (high school diploma, associate’s degree, or global equivalent):** At least 60 months leading projects and 35 hours of project management education/training or CAPM® Certification.

These months must be unique and non-overlapping.  Meaning, you can’t count the same month towards multiple projects.  The key phrase is "leading projects." This doesn't necessarily mean you were the project manager in title. It focuses on whether you actively directed and managed project activities.

PMI breaks down project management into five key process groups:

*   **Initiating:** Defining the project scope, objectives, and stakeholders.
*   **Planning:** Developing the project management plan, including schedules, budgets, and resource allocation.
*   **Executing:** Carrying out the project activities according to the plan.
*   **Monitoring and Controlling:** Tracking project progress, managing risks, and ensuring quality.
*   **Closing:** Formalizing project completion and documenting lessons learned.

Your experience must demonstrate involvement across these process groups.

## PMP Experience Examples Across Industries

## Tips for Articulating Your PMP Experience

*   **Use the PMI Terminology:** Frame your experience using the PMI's language. Focus on demonstrating your involvement in the five process groups and knowledge areas outlined in the *PMBOK® Guide*.

*   **Be Specific and Quantifiable:** Don't just say you "managed a project." Provide details about the project's budget, team size, timeline, and key deliverables. Use numbers and metrics to quantify your accomplishments. For example, "Reduced project costs by 15% by implementing a more efficient resource allocation strategy."

*   **Highlight Your Leadership Skills:** The PMP certification emphasizes leadership. Highlight your ability to motivate teams, resolve conflicts, and make effective decisions. Use action verbs to describe your contributions, such as "led," "directed," "managed," "coordinated," and "facilitated."

*   **Focus on Your Contributions:** Even if you were part of a larger project team, focus on your specific role and contributions. What were your responsibilities? What challenges did you overcome? How did you contribute to the project's success?

*   **Be Honest and Accurate:** PMI audits a percentage of applications. Ensure that all information you provide is truthful and accurate. Be prepared to provide supporting documentation if requested.

*   **Review and Proofread:** Carefully review and proofread your application before submitting it. Errors and omissions can delay the application process.
