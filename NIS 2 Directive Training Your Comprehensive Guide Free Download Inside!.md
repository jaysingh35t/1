## What is the NIS 2 Directive?

Building on the original NIS Directive, NIS 2 expands its scope significantly. It addresses the shortcomings of the first iteration, primarily the inconsistent implementation and levels of cybersecurity readiness across member states. NIS 2 aims to harmonize cybersecurity standards and incident reporting obligations, making it more robust and enforceable.

Here's a breakdown of the key improvements and changes introduced by NIS 2:

*   **Expanded Scope:** NIS 2 applies to a much wider range of organizations than the original directive. It categorizes entities into "essential" and "important" based on their criticality to the economy and society. Sectors now included are digital infrastructure, waste management, manufacturing, food production, and more.
*   **Stricter Security Requirements:** The directive mandates organizations to implement risk management measures and specific cybersecurity practices. These include incident handling, business continuity and disaster recovery, supply chain security (including security aspects related to the relationships between each entity and its direct suppliers and direct service providers), vulnerability management, and policies and procedures to assess the effectiveness of cybersecurity risk management measures.
*   **Harmonized Reporting Obligations:** NIS 2 introduces more detailed and harmonized incident reporting requirements. Organizations must report significant incidents to national authorities within specific timeframes, allowing for quicker responses and coordinated actions.
*   **Enhanced Enforcement:** The directive strengthens the enforcement mechanisms, including significantly higher fines for non-compliance. This incentivizes organizations to take cybersecurity seriously and invest in appropriate security measures.
*   **Supply Chain Security:** Recognizing the interconnectedness of digital supply chains, NIS 2 places a strong emphasis on supply chain security. Organizations are responsible for assessing and managing the cybersecurity risks associated with their suppliers and service providers.
*   **Management Accountability:** The directive explicitly holds management bodies accountable for ensuring their organizations comply with NIS 2 requirements. This places cybersecurity at the forefront of business decisions and encourages a top-down approach to risk management.
