## Important Considerations: Degree and Accreditation

While this document primarily focuses on online courses that provide introductory knowledge or skills enhancement, it's crucial to understand the requirements for becoming a licensed Occupational Therapist.

To become a licensed Occupational Therapist (OT), you generally need:

*   **Bachelor's Degree:**  A bachelor's degree is typically required for admission to an accredited Master's degree program in Occupational Therapy. While the bachelor's degree doesn't need to be in a specific field, courses in biology, anatomy, psychology, and sociology are often recommended.
*   **Master's Degree in Occupational Therapy:**  Complete a Master of Science in Occupational Therapy (MSOT) or a Master of Occupational Therapy (MOT) program accredited by the Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education (ACOTE). These programs typically involve two to three years of full-time study, including classroom instruction, laboratory work, and clinical fieldwork.
*   **Clinical Fieldwork:**  Complete supervised clinical fieldwork experiences in various settings, such as hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and schools. Fieldwork provides hands-on experience working with patients under the guidance of experienced OTs.
*   **National Certification Examination:** Pass the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy (NBCOT) examination. This standardized exam assesses your knowledge and skills in occupational therapy.
*   **State Licensure:** Obtain a license to practice occupational therapy from the state in which you plan to work. Licensing requirements vary by state, but typically include graduation from an accredited OT program and passing the NBCOT examination.

**Important Note:**  Online courses mentioned earlier *do not* replace the need for a formal, ACOTE-accredited Master's program and licensure. These courses are supplemental or introductory in nature.  They can, however, be valuable in exploring the field and strengthening your application to a formal OT program.

A career in occupational therapy offers a rewarding opportunity to make a positive impact on the lives of others. Online courses can be a valuable tool for exploring the field, enhancing your skills, and preparing for graduate studies. Remember to choose courses carefully, considering the instructor's credentials, course content, and learning format.
