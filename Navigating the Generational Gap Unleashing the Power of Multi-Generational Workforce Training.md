## The Generational Landscape: A Quick Overview

Before diving into training strategies, it's crucial to understand the characteristics and values often associated with each generation currently present in the workforce:

*   **Generation X (Born 1965-1980):** Independent, resourceful, and adaptable. They appreciate direct communication, work-life balance, and opportunities for growth.
*   **Millennials (Born 1981-1996):** Tech-savvy, collaborative, and purpose-driven. They seek feedback, value continuous learning, and desire meaningful work.
*   **Generation Z (Born 1997-2012):** Digital natives, entrepreneurial, and pragmatic. They value flexibility, authenticity, and opportunities for innovation.

It's important to remember that these are generalizations, and individual differences exist within each generation. However, understanding these broad trends can help shape more effective training programs.
