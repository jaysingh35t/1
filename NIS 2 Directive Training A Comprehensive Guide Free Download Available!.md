## What is the NIS 2 Directive?

The NIS 2 Directive (Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems Directive (EU) 2022/2555) is a European Union (EU) law aimed at improving cybersecurity across the EU member states. It builds upon the original NIS Directive (NIS 1) and expands its scope and requirements to address the shortcomings and emerging threats identified since its initial implementation.

**Key Objectives of NIS 2:**

*   **Harmonization:** To create a more consistent and harmonized approach to cybersecurity across EU member states.
*   **Expanded Scope:** To broaden the scope of organizations covered by cybersecurity regulations, including essential and important entities.
*   **Enhanced Security Requirements:** To impose more stringent security requirements on covered entities.
*   **Improved Incident Reporting:** To establish more robust incident reporting mechanisms.
*   **Stronger Enforcement:** To provide national authorities with stronger enforcement powers, including penalties for non-compliance.

## Who Does NIS 2 Affect?

NIS 2 significantly expands the range of organizations that fall under cybersecurity regulations. It categorizes entities as either "essential" or "important" based on their criticality to society and the economy.
